    Given a Linked List, where every node represents a sub-linked-list and contains two pointers:
(i) a next pointer to the next node,
(ii) a bottom pointer to a linked list where this node is head.
Each of the sub-linked lists is in sorted order.
Flatten the Link List so all the nodes appear in a single level while maintaining the sorted order.

Note: The flattened list will be printed using the bottom pointer instead of the next pointer. Look at the printList() function in the driver code for more clarity.

Examples:

Input:

Output:  5-> 7-> 8- > 10 -> 19-> 20-> 22-> 28-> 30-> 35-> 40-> 45-> 50.
Explanation: The resultant linked lists has every node in a single level.(Note: | represents the bottom pointer.)
