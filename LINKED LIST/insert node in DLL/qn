Given a doubly-linked list, a position p, and an integer x. The task is to add a new node with value x at the position just after pth node in the doubly linked list.

Example 1:

Input:
LinkedList: 2<->4<->5
p = 2, x = 6 
Output: 2 4 5 6
Explanation: p = 2, and x = 6. So, 6 is
inserted after p, i.e, at position 3
(0-based indexing).
