Given an unsorted array Arr[] of N integers and an integer X, find floor and ceiling of X in Arr[0..N-1].

Floor of X is the largest element which is smaller than or equal to X. Floor of X doesn’t exist if X is smaller than smallest element of Arr[].

Ceil of X is the smallest element which is greater than or equal to X. Ceil of X doesn’t exist if X is greater than greatest element of Arr[].
